/*
 * Java Enums ==>
 * 
 * Enums were introduced in Java 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one of
 * only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called
 * enums.
 * 
 * With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your
 * code.
 * 
 * For example, if we consider an application for a fresh juice shop, it would
 * be possible to restrict the glass size to small, medium, and large. This
 * would make sure that it would not allow anyone to order any size other than
 * small, medium, or large.
 * 
 * Note âˆ’ Enums can be declared as their own or inside a class. Methods,
 * variables, constructors can be defined inside enums as well.
