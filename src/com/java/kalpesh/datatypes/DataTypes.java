/*
 * Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This
 * means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory.
 * 
 * Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory
 * and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by
 * assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers,
 * decimals, or characters in these variables.
 * 
 * There are two data types available in Java âˆ’
 * 
 * Primitive Data Types
 * 
 * Reference/Object Data Types
 * 
 * 
 * Primitive Data Types ==> There are eight primitive datatypes supported by
 * Java. Primitive datatypes are predefined by the language and named by a
 * keyword. Let us now look into the eight primitive data types in detail.
 * 
 * byte ==>
 * 
 * Byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer
 * 
 * Minimum value is -128 (-2^7)
 * 
 * Maximum value is 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)
 * 
 * Default value is 0
 * 
 * Byte data type is used to save space in large arrays, mainly in place of
 * integers, since a byte is four times smaller than an integer.
 * 
 * Example: byte a = 100, byte b = -50
 * 
 * short ==>
 * 
 * Short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer
 * 
 * Minimum value is -32,768 (-2^15)
 * 
 * Maximum value is 32,767 (inclusive) (2^15 -1)
 * 
 * Short data type can also be used to save memory as byte data type. A short is
 * 2 times smaller than an integer
 * 
 * Default value is 0.
 * 
 * Example: short s = 10000, short r = -20000
 * 
 * int ==>
 * 
 * Int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer.
 * 
 * Minimum value is - 2,147,483,648 (-2^31)
 * 
 * Maximum value is 2,147,483,647(inclusive) (2^31 -1)
 * 
 * Integer is generally used as the default data type for integral values unless
 * there is a concern about memory.
 * 
 * The default value is 0
 * 
 * Example: int a = 100000, int b = -200000
 * 
 * long ==>
 * 
 * Long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer Minimum value is
 * -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63) Maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
 * (inclusive)(2^63 -1) This type is used when a wider range than int is needed
 * Default value is 0L Example: long a = 100000L, long b = -200000L float Float
 * data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
 * 
 * float ==>
 * 
 * Float is mainly used to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers
 * 
 * Default value is 0.0f
 * 
 * Float data type is never used for precise values such as currency
 * 
 * Example: float f1 = 234.5f
 * 
 * double ==>
 * 
 * Double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
 * 
 * This data type is generally used as the default data type for decimal values,
 * generally the default choice
 * 
 * Double data type should never be used for precise values such as currency
 * 
 * Default value is 0.0d
 * 
 * Example: double d1 = 123.4
 * 
 * boolean ==>
 * 
 * boolean data type represents one bit of information There are only two
 * possible values: true and false This data type is used for simple flags that
 * track true/false conditions Default value is false Example: boolean one =
 * true
 * 
 * char ==>
 * 
 * char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character Minimum value is '\u0000'
 * (or 0) Maximum value is '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive) Char data type is used
 * to store any character Example: char letterA = 'A'
 * 
 * Reference Datatypes ==>
 * 
 * Reference variables are created using defined constructors of the classes.
 * They are used to access objects. These variables are declared to be of a
 * specific type that cannot be changed. For example, Employee, Puppy, etc.
 * 
 * Class objects and various type of array variables comes under reference
 * datatype.
 * 
 * Default value of any reference variable is null.
 * 
 * A reference variable can be used to refer any object of the declared type or
 * any compatible type.
 * 
 * Example: Animal animal = new Animal("giraffe");
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Notation Character represented \n Newline (0x0a) \r Carriage return (0x0d) \f
 * Formfeed (0x0c) \b Backspace (0x08) \s Space (0x20) \t tab \" Double quote \'
 * Single quote \\ backslash \ddd Octal character (ddd)
